  <h1>Youtube Groups</h1>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>
    Churches are organizations that thrive on in-person gatherings, usually with
    large amounts of people. When people attend church in person, they get to see
    a lot of people in one place that they don’t see throughout the week. They
    also hug each other and make connections through eye contact and nonverbal
    communication During the pandemic, such gatherings have become restricted.
    Many people within churches rely on such in-person gatherings to maintain
    personal connections. An example of something that people do together in
    church that isn’t the same online is singing songs. Much like going to a
    concert is different than just listening to music at home. Meetings of small
    groups within churches have leveraged online tools such as Zoom to continue to
    meet together in a safe way. Online meetings like these still lack the
    intimacy that many church-goers enjoy when meeting face to face.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

  <p>
    Because of the pandemic, churches, which traditionally rely on large in-person
    gatherings, have had to move church services online. Church gatherings, which
    generally involve more intimate personal connections than jobs or school, lack
    the personal connections people expect. When attending church services online,
    people want to be able to see each other and to communicate casually as they
    would in an in-person setting, but have a hard time doing so in an online
    environment.
  </p>

  <h2>Finding out what people want</h2>
  <p>
    My main goal in conducting research was to find out more about people’s
    experience with attending church services online. I chose to do interviews
    because I wanted to be able to dig a little deeper and find out what specific
    aspects of meeting in person they missed. Doing a survey might get me general
    answers such as finding in-person church services more personal and doing an
    observation would be difficult because an online church service is mostly
    passive rather than active such as ordering food from a delivery service. I
    conducted eight interviews. Most of my participants are regular church
    attendees who are active in the church community and desire to be connected in
    person and attend church regularly online. There could be implications for the
    research for people who don’t attend church regularly. Attending church
    services online provides an easy way for people who might be busy or not ready
    to jump into fully joining a church community.
  </p>

  <h2>What people are missing</h2>
  <p>
    The main thing I found was that online meetings are not as personal as
    in-person meetings. You can’t get a sense of peoples’ body language. When
    meeting together in a program like Zoom for midweek church meetings or
    watching church services on YouTube, if there are too many people, it is
    difficult to maintain a more personal atmosphere. Specifically with YouTube,
    when watching a live stream of a church service, you can use the live chat,
    but it is just one general chat, you cannot chat with a specific person or
    even a smaller group. One person I interviewed said that they want to be able
    to see the faces of other people attending the service. They wanted something
    similar to a Zoom layout on YouTube while watching services live.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another finding was that whatever platform people were using to connect with
    groups online, the larger the group, the harder it was for less dominant
    personalities to join conversations or the harder it was to keep conversations
    going since people interact naturally with smaller groups in-person rather
    than in larger groups.

  <h2>User Flows</h2>

  <h2>User Personas</h2>
  <h3>Amanda</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Loves listening to podcasts</li>
    <li>
      Doesn’t speak up in Zoom meetings when others are dominating the
      conversation
    </li>
    <li>
      Comfortable with technology, but spends a lot of time on her computer for
      work
    </li>
    <li>Favorite part of church service is the lesson</li>
    <li>Likes seeing people’s faces during church</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dave</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Favorite part of church is the music</li>
    <li>Loves listening to music and singing with other people</li>
    <li>Easily distracted when watching church online</li>
    <li>Loves connecting with people in the chat</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <h3>Zoom</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Has video chat</li>
    <li>Allows you to watch something using screen share</li>
    <li>You can text chat</li>
    <li>Can’t see all participants and shared screen at the same time</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Facebook</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can watch videos with others</li>
    <li>Has text chat</li>
    <li>No video chat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Zoom and Facebook are popular alternatives to YouTube for churches to
    livestream their services. Zoom allows people to have a small video chat group
    that they can interact with during service, but if you are watching a video,
    someone has to share their screen and you can’t see other people on mobile.
  </p>
  <p>
    Facebook allows you to watch videos and have live text chat, but it doesn’t
    allow you to have a video chat session. Allowing users to have video chat
    native to YouTube will allow them to watch church services together without
    having to use multiple apps.
  </p>

  <h2>Low Fidelity Prototypes</h2>

  <h2>User Testing</h2>
  <p>
    I tested both versions of the flow with two users. They both got through the
    flow pretty easily. One user didn’t understand at first that it was a
    clickable prototype. Once they realized that though, they got through it
    quickly. They both liked the second flow more. The bigger group cards in the
    second screen felt better to them. In the third screen, the chat in the second
    flow being in its own separate section was preferred. Being able to minimize
    the chat was something both users wanted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also showed users the alternative group list screen that shows the user
    icons of who is in the group. This gives a better representation of what group
    it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    When testing, a couple other issues also came up. For the text chat, should
    users in a group be able to engage in the chat with everyone watching the
    video, only the people in their group, or both? Also, how are groups created
    and who can create them? This isn’t part of my user flow, but it is an
    important consideration. One of the users asked whether participants would be
    able to stay in the group to discuss a live stream even after it ends.
  </p>

  <h2>Point of view</h2>
  <p>
    Users should be given as much information as possible about the groups when
    they are choosing which one to join. When in a group, the group should be the
    main focus, but users should also be able to engage with a global chat for the
    video. The group should also persist after a livestream is over, but I need to
    figure out a reasonable amount of time for this. YouTube is a video watching
    platform and not a chat platform, but it makes sense that people might want to
    talk after a livestream and not be cut off immediately.
